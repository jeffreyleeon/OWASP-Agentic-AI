# Agent Critical System Interaction

### Description

Agent Critical System Interaction vulnerabilities occur when AI agents interact with critical infrastructure, IoT devices, or sensitive operational systems. This vulnerability class is particularly dangerous as it can lead to physical consequences, operational disruptions, and safety incidents. The autonomous nature of AI agents combined with access to critical systems creates unique risks that can affect both digital and physical infrastructure.

* **Physical System Manipulation** occurs when attackers exploit agent control over physical infrastructure or industrial systems to cause operational disruptions or safety incidents.
* **IoT Device Compromise** happens when attackers manipulate how agents interact with connected devices, potentially leading to device malfunction or unauthorized control.
* **Critical Infrastructure Access** involves unauthorized or malicious use of agent permissions to access and control critical systems.

The impact of successful attacks can range from operational disruptions to potentially catastrophic failures in critical infrastructure systems.

### Common Examples of Vulnerability

1. Attackers manipulate agents controlling industrial control systems to cause equipment damage.
2. Malicious exploitation of agent access to smart building systems compromises physical security.
3. Agents controlling IoT devices are compromised to create security breaches.
4. Critical infrastructure systems are accessed through compromised agent credentials.
5. Safety systems are bypassed through manipulated agent commands.

### Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. Implement strict access controls:
   - System isolation
   - Access segregation
   - Permission management
      - AI agent should be allowed to interact only with predefined list of critical systems needed to perform an assigned task
      - AI agent should be provisioned for a predefined and pre-verified minimal viable permissions list to perform assigned tasks
      - If AI agent is using proxy identity within critical system ( like service account), that identity should also have predefined list of permissions in terms of allowed actions and data access requested by AI agent
   - System isolation 
   - Access segregation to prevent any potential violation of Segregation of Duties policies 
   - Permission management should be governed and applied along the full workflow process from start of the task execution to the finish. All permissions should be assigned based on task in hands
   - Command validation
   - Physical security controls

2. Establish operational safeguards:
   - Safety interlocks
   - Command verification
   - Operational limits
   - Emergency shutdown procedures
   - Redundancy systems

3. Deploy monitoring systems:
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Command logging
   - Physical system monitoring
   - Security alerts

4. Create safety mechanisms:
   - Fail-safe defaults
   - Safety boundaries
   - Emergency controls
   - Override systems
   - Backup procedures

5. Implement validation systems:
   - Command verification
   - Action validation
   - System checks
   - Safety compliance
   - Regular audits

### Example Attack Scenarios

1. An attacker compromises an AI agent controlling industrial equipment, manipulating it to operate beyond safe parameters while bypassing standard safety controls.

2. A sophisticated attack on an agent managing smart building systems allows unauthorized access to secure areas by manipulating access control systems.

3. An attacker exploits an agent's IoT device control capabilities to disable security systems and create physical security vulnerabilities.

4. A malicious actor compromises an agent with access to critical infrastructure, using its legitimate permissions to gradually introduce systemic vulnerabilities.

5. An attack manipulates an agent's safety monitoring functions, causing it to ignore or misreport critical safety violations in industrial processes.
